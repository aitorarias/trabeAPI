# GraphQL API given a model

Given a model created by Trabe, the aim is to create a GraphQL API, where:

- Query the account and its movements.
- Mutations to add balance and withdrawals
- Authentication

## Set up the project

```shell
npm install
```

## Launch the project

```
npm start
```

At port 4000, you will end up at the Apollo Server Playground, where you can make queries and mutations availables.
